    "In this culminating project for STARS, you will work in groups to define your own research question on galaxies.  As a group, you will then use the SDSS-IV/MaNGA dataset, along with the analysis tools you've become familiar with as part of STARS, to answer this question.\n",

    "Each group will have an advisor assigned to them.  The advisor's role will be to provide feedback on the chosen research question, as well as the group's planned experimental design.  The advisor may also provide limited guidance on new analysis techniques in case they are needed.  However, all project work will be led by group members.\n",
